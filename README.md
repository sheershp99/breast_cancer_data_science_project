# Breast Cancer Data Science Project

Breast Cancer has become one of common type of cancers these days. This project aims to create a machine learning model which is capable of classifying whether a breast cancer tumor is benign or malignant. This dataset consists of 569 rows and 32 columns. <br>

The dataset contains features of a tumor like radium, area, perimeter, texture, smoothness etc. Using these features, I have created 4 different classification machine learning models and after training & testing them, compared their accuracy to find which models works best for this type of dataset.
